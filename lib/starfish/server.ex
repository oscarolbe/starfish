defmodule Starfish.Server do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is responsible for the election of the leader.

  ## Monitoring the current leader

  Once every @t_seconds, each node sends a :ping message to the leader,
  if the leader does not respond within the 4 Ã— @t_seconds,
  he is considered retired and the current node begins the election of a new leader.

  ## Election of a new leader

  All nodes know each other's addresses and ports. There are 3 nodes in the network,
  new nodes can be added in @all_nodes

  Nodes have unique IDs and are sorted by their seniority.

  3 kinds of messages: :alive?, :fine_thanks and :i_am_the_king.

  The node that started the election sends an :alive? message to all nodes more senior than itself.
  And waits for :fine_thanks response.

  If no node responds with :fine_thanks within @t_seconds, the node declares itself the leader
  and sends out an :i_am_the_king message.
  If the node has received a :fine_thanks response, it waits for T seconds for an :i_am_the_king message.
  If it doesn't wait, it starts the election procedure again.
  When receiving ALIVE? the node responds with :fine_thanks and starts a new election itself.

  if received :alive? Since the node is already the most senior,
  it immediately sends an :i_am_the_king message.
  Nodes that receive an :i_am_the_king message begin to assume the leader of the node that sends them.

  Newly started nodes initiate the leader selection procedure immediately after starting.
